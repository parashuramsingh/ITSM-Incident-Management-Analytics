# ITSM Incident Management Analytics Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes IT Service Management (ITSM) incident data stored in a MySQL database and implements multiple business use cases using Data Science and Machine Learning.

## Use Cases Implemented
1. Predicting High Priority Tickets (Priority 1 & 2)
2. Incident Volume Forecasting (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual)
3. Auto-tagging Tickets with Priority and Department
4. Predicting RFC Failures and IT Asset Misconfiguration Risk

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Time Series Forecasting (SARIMA)
- MySQL Database
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset was provided in MySQL database format (no CSV files were shared). Data was extracted using Python MySQL connector.

## Key Outcomes
- Built ML models for ticket priority prediction
- Forecasted future incident volume trends
- Automated ticket classification
- Provided business recommendations for ITSM optimization
